bugs
1. jitter with projects on hover

COOLIO MOOLIO:
- have a "pictures" page which displays lots of random picture files pinterest-style with the irregular grid
- can display drawings and higurashi poster here, since they're not really displayable elsewhere

HOW TO *actually* MAKE THE LIST MORE UNIQUE:
- logos wont work
- style of each project varies depending on the creator
- mixed creator projects will have one default cluttery style
- in the EXPLORE section,
    - every few projects will have one big one with the same style as the featured project
    - the other non-special projects will use default boring style
    - hovering over a project will do the thing steam does with a thing on the right
    - project title color will depend on completeness state
    - all projects will have their own image
- text only projects
    - will have an autogenerated gradient behind a logo as their image
    - the autogenerated gradient will look like the background with the dots and stuff
- ONGOING
    - projects here will have their style changed too
    - have a big "WIP" type logo on top (maybe a spinning gear or something)
- TAGS
    - each will have their own icon

HOW TO MAKE THE LIST MORE UNIQUE:
- the design of each list element will be based on tags, date, and completeness
- older, dead projects can have a cobwebby look
- completed ones are shimmery
- video ones can look like a youtube video
- website ones can look like teeny websites
- game ones can look like games
- game/website ones look like cookie clicker
- mostly-text ones can look like a book
- story ones can look like a book with characters on it

- fast: 0.2s;

For Today:
- add "ongoing", "dead", etc. tags to display
- find a way to make genericProjects look not crap
- fix searching by tag
- fix opening links
- make it so that you can see new recommendeds
- add eevolutoon.png, spaceArchives.png, csOne.png, valEdTwo.png
- add dates
  //date display should be very casual, like the date /~11/2020 would be interpreted as "sometime around november last year"

For Tomorrow:
- fix "this minute's featured project" so it actually works
- share the website with paris

modifiable values:
amountToDisplay at createOngoingProjects()
    - changes initial amount of ongoingProjects to display when homepage is loaded
