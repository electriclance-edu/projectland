dark blue - rgb(30,40,55)

For Today:
- add "ongoing", "dead", etc. tags to display
- find a way to make genericProjects look not crap
- fix searching by tag
- fix opening links
- make it so that you can see new recommendeds
- add dates
  //date display should be very casual, like the date /~11/2020 would be interpreted as "sometime around november last year"

For Tomorrow:
- fix "this minute's featured project" so it actually works

modifiable values:
amountToDisplay at createOngoingProjects()
    - changes initial amount of ongoingProjects to display when homepage is loaded
